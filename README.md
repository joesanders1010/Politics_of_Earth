# POLITICS OF EARTH<br> A Research Project About Bringing Us Together When It Feels Like We Couldn't Be Further Apart

# **Background**
Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, and regardless of where in the world you live, you likely have felt the impacts of political divisiveness, especially over the last several years. As the stressors being placed on the world increase, so too do the tensions democracies across the world are feeling. Add to this the echo chambers created by social media, and it becomes easy to forget or lose sight of one another’s point of view.<br><br>
Two- and three-party systems — the modus operandi of many democracies — aren’t serving the citizenry. We are forced to build ad hoc political coalitions in order to ensure “we” win office, or “they” are forced out. This is why every election cycle there is a focus on “moderates” and “independents” — voters that change allegiances each election, and on which constituencies might be won over THIS cycle.<br><br>
Here’s the problem: that doesn’t actually help anyone.<br><br>
Those who have their feet firmly planted in a specific ideology have to make concessions before a single ballot is cast in order to woo new social or demographic groups into uneasy alliances.<br><br>
Those who are being fought over — those in “the middle” — are being lumped together in the same haphazard way that popcorn and Fruit-by-the-Foot are both lumped into that category of “snacks.” Their unique wants and needs get watered down because “moderate” has become a synonym for “other.” It doesn’t make sense!<br><br>
What would happen if we understood what the citizens of Earth ACTUALLY wanted, in an empirical way? What if we could concretely identify the political ideologies that naturally cluster together in PRACTICE instead of in THEORY, and formed more representative political coalitions based on those clusters that represented our interests both at home AND abroad?

# **The Project**
We sought to use publicly sourced data from our survey to do several things:

*  Create an unsupervised learning model to determine the number of political “clusters” that exist in the world today. To be clear, these clusters would identify people who share strong beliefs across social and economic spectrums, with a goal to maximize the number of clusters without sacrificing the integrity of the model.
*   Create a supervised learning model that would predict the probability that a new participant is in a given cluster.
*   Create a publicly available website where future participants would be able to take the above-linked survey, and get real-time results on which political cluster they belong to, and based on which beliefs.
*   Use the data sourced from the website test to further enrich the unsupervised learning model, making it more accurate over time.

## What were our Hypotheses (H1's)?

* We hypothesized that we would be able to clearly identify some number of political “clusters” that could be the basis of new, international political coalitions.
* We hypothesized that participants in each nation would be evenly distributed across those coalitions.
* We hypothesized that for any cluster, they would be able to form at least one single-issue-based alliance with any other cluster.
* Specific to the United States, we hypothesized that the proposed coalitions would not naturally align with the current two-party system.

## But Why the Whole World?
There are a few reasons for this. <br><br>
We believed that as we move towards a global economy, we should also head toward positioning our political beliefs globally. This doesn’t mean being united under a single government (necessarily), but it does mean having the same conversations on the local, grass-roots level that we’re having on the international stage. This should increase diplomacy naturally while also helping to re-enfranchise people who no longer feel represented by the political process.<br><br>
We were curious to see how results change when you cluster the whole world versus individual countries. For example, are so-called “conservatives” the same everywhere, or how vastly does “conservative” ideology change from nation to nation?<br><br>
We were curious to see how closely clustered the results from a given country are. For example, would all citizens from a given country be closely clustered regardless of political ideology?<br><br>
To the best of our knowledge, no similar studies have been conducted on an international scale.

# **Methodology**
We gathered data from participants using a survey, and then ran relevant experiements to uncover possible clusters:
* 64 questions spanning 11 political dimensions (Domestic Policy, Foreign Policy, Race/Gender/Sexual Orientation, etc.)
* A free-form text box for each political dimension for eventual language analysis
* We ran cluster analysis on each political dimension, and on four “decision-making” dimensions based on dichotomies found in psychology & ethics
* We used a stepwise selection process so that only statistically relevant questions were considered

# **Results**
In all, the decision-making clusters from psychology and ethics were a more reliable method for identifying what clusters a member might be a part of. A single survey response could drastically change the number of clusters visible in the political clusters, but by create a dichotomy, we instead could shift our analysis to how these clusters interacted.

Satisfaction with the Status Quo had strong correlation with Needs Prioritization (p = -.67) and Moral Purity (p = -.65).
* Institutionalists are more likely to be Individualists and Absolutists
* Anarchists are more likely to be Collectivists and Relativists.

<br>Further, political dimensions were distributed across decision-making dimensions. Further research should be conducted to see if there is an explicit relationship between decision-making clusters and political clusters.

# **Opportunities for Future Research**
**RE-EVALUATE & ITERATE WITH MORE RESPONDENTS**
<br>It was was not possible to make sound statistical conclusions for each hypothesis with the amount of data gathered thus far.<br><br>
**DEEPER ANALYSIS OF ALL DIMENSIONS**
<br>With the large amount of quantitative and text data gathered from each respondent, further research should be conducted to see if there are meaningful connections between political and decision-making dimensions.<br><br>
**LANGUAGE ANALYSIS OF FREE-FORM COMMENTS**
<br>There is considerable text data that could be used in an analysis of the rhetoric used by each decision-making dimension.
